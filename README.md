# noder_checker

I'm currently working on a small playground env you can use to isolate and test a function away from the main code base.
It will be a quick boilerplate to help you get up and testing quickly!

This comes with a ready made jest checker that will test for alive server and a DDOS checker. I have also added a rate limiter in the package to help you know how to fix the problem in other existing routes.
